	<span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Details about the Record distributor flow for the 
	<span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern. </p>
	<p>The flow performs the following actions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A file is selected for processing in accordance with the file input parameters.</li>
<li>Records are read from the file in accordance with the record detection parameters.
Each record is processed within a transaction. 
If validation is specified, the record is validated against a message set.</li>
<li>The Route subflow is called to determine the correct WebSphere MQ destination 
and the record is written to the correct target queue. 
When a record is written to a queue, by default it is in the same format as it was read from the file.
If required, you can transform the record to another format by customizing the Record Processor flow.</li>
<li>If <span class="msobjpropval">No routing</span> is selected, 
the record is written to the default message queue.</li>
<li>If errors occur, for example failure to read a record or to write a record to a queue, 
an error message is written and the flow is backed out.
The file is written to the backout directory.</li>
<li>When all the data is processed, the Log subflow is called to record completion.
If any records have been written to the default message queue, this action is noted.</li>
<li>The flow ends successfully and the file is moved to the archive subdirectory.</li>
