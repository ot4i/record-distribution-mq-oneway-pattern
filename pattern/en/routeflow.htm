<p class="shortdesc">Details about the Route subflow for the 
	<span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> 
	pattern. </p>

<p>The behavior of the Route subflow depends on the value of the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> pattern 
parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="msobjpropval">No routing</span>
<p>If <span class="msobjpropval">No routing</span> is selected, 
a single MQOutput node is created and 
configured with the values of the <span class="msobjprop">Output queue manager</span> and 
<span class="msobjprop">Output queue</span> 
pattern parameters. The routing flow is a subflow that includes a Passthrough node. 
Both default and route terminals are included so that this subflow 
is consistent with all other types of routing subflow, 
but the single route terminal only is used.
</p></li>


<li><span class="msobjpropval">Specify routes</span>
<p> A group of four parameters that define a route:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="msobjprop">Key location</span> 
is an expression that defines a key location within the current message element. 
For more information about the type of expression to use, 
see "Route node" and "Using XPath" in the IBM Integration documentation.</li>
<li><span class="msobjprop">Key value</span> 
defines a value that the key location must match if this route is taken.</li>
<li><span class="msobjprop">Queue manager</span> 
defines the route as a queue manager.</li>
<li><span class="msobjprop">Queue</span> 
defines the route as a queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each route that is defined, an Output terminal for the Route subflow and an MQOutput node
are created and connected. </p>
<p>The Route subflow contains a Route node that is configured with a filter that routes 
to the first Output terminal for which the condition <tt>KeyLocation = Key Value</tt> is fulfilled.
If a message element does not match any of the routes, this situation is recorded in a
variable in the broker environment tree and the message is passed to the Default terminal.</p>
<p>If the XPATH expression defining a <span class="msobjprop">Key location</span> includes a
namespace qualifier, the tag defining the namespace must be added to the Namespace table.</p>

<p>You might see a warning on the Route node that is similar to the following message:
 <tt>Filter table: Filter pattern: The <var>element_name</var> schema element was not found in the 
 <span class="msobjpropval">Key location = Key value</span> XPath.</tt>
 This warning does not cause any problems when you deploy and run your pattern instance.</p>
<p>You can specify a number of different routes by selecting  
<span class="msobjpropval">Specify routes</span>.</p></li>



<li><span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span>
<p>If this value is selected, routes are determined by using values from the message data to look up the 
queue manager and queue from a database routing table. The routing table is not accessed directly,
but is read and cached in memory for greater efficiency.</p>
<p>If this value is selected a single Output terminal is created for the Route subflow. The Output terminal 
is connected to a single MQOutput node that is configured to take a list of destinations that have been 
placed in the broker environment tree by the lookup.</p>
<p>The Route subflow checks whether the cache requires refreshing, by checking if the value of the 
<span class="filepath">CacheQueueTable.valid</span> shared row variable is set to <tt>NULL</tt>. 
The variable is set to <tt>NULL</tt> when the flow starts, and when 
<span class="msobjprop">Cache refresh</span> is enabled and a refresh message has been sent to 
<span class="msobjprop">Refresh queue</span>. Refresh messages set the value to <tt>NULL</tt>.</p>
<p>If the cache requires refreshing, the ROUTING_TABLE table of the data source, which is specified in the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing data source</span> pattern parameter, is searched to find all of the rows 
that match the routing context for this flow. The routing context is defined by the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing data context</span> pattern parameter, and the rows in which the 
ROUTING_CONTEXT field matches this parameter are read into an in-memory cache, which is done atomically 
to prevent lookups while the cache is in an inconsistent state.</p>
<p>The structure of the cached data is:</p>
<pre>VARIABLE1, VARIABLE2, QUEUE_MANAGER, QUEUE_NAME </pre>
<p>The lookup is performed by extracting one, or two,
key values from the message element by using ESQL expressions that are defined as
pattern parameters. The lookup is defined by using a statement in the following form: </p>
<pre>SET KEY = &lt;pattern parameter&gt;</pre>
<p>If a single key is specified to select a row, or rows,
from the routing data, use the following WHERE clause for selection: </p>
<pre>WHERE S.VARIABLE1 = KEY1</pre> 
<p>If a second key is specified, use the following WHERE clause 
for selection: </p>
<pre>WHERE S.VARIABLE1 = KEY1 and S.VARIABLE2 = KEY2</pre>
<p>This selection sets the queue manager and queue into the list of destinations
that is used by the MQOutput node. Multiple rows can
be returned, and the destination data includes all the selected
destinations. If a match is not found, a routing error occurs and the
message is passed to the Failure terminal of the Route subflow.</p></li>
