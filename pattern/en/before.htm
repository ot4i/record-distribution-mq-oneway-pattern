	<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete before applying the 
	<span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, you must determine
which of the following tasks are required. If required, complete the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify that this pattern meets the business requirements and 
can be supported by both file creators and message consumers.</li>
<li>Name the pattern instance. 
Identify the purpose of the pattern application so that you can decide on an 
appropriate name.</li>
<li>Decide whether you require logging. 
If logging is required, you must decide to which queue manager and 
queue the logging messages are sent. Logging might be to a general log queue, 
which already exists 
for other broker flows or to a queue that is created for the pattern instance.</li>
<li>Decide whether you require error messages. 
If error messages are required, you must decide to which queue manager and 
queue the error messages are sent.</li>
<li>Decide how records are detected and, if required, 
prepare a message set to define how records are parsed. </li>
<li>Decide if validation is required and, if required,
prepare a message set to define how records are parsed.</li>
<li>Determine whether the files that are to be processed are local or remote. 
If remote files are to be processed, the name of the configurable service must be identified.</li>
<li>Decide if multiple possible destinations exist. If multiple possible destinations exist, 
select the routing approach to use.
	<ul>
	<li>If you have a limited number of routes where 
	the destinations do not change frequently, 
	set the <span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter to 
	<span class="msobjpropval">Specify routes</span>.</li>
	<li>If the set of target routes is not fully determined or might change
	frequently, set the <span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter to 
	<span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span>. If this value is
	selected, the name of the data source must be known.</li>
	</ul></li>
