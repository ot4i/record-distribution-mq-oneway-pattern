	<h1 class="topictitle1">Error subflow for the <span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">This subflow tests whether an error message must be written and is determined 
	by the user-defined property: <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span>.</p>
<p>If an error is caught during processing in the message flows, the Error subflow is called. 
The following actions are taken by the Error subflow:
</p>	
<ol>	
<li>If error messages are required, an error message is prepared and written to the error queue.
Details of the exception are written as an XML message. These details include:
	<ul>
	<li>Broker name</li>
	<li>Flow name</li>
	<li>Time stamp</li>
	<li>File directory</li>
	<li>File name</li>
	<li>Record number, when error occurred</li>
	<li>Number of records written to default queue</li>
	<li>Summary of the exception data</li>
	</ul>
<p>The summary of the exception data contains the message flow label, error number, text description, 
and a list of inserts giving further details.</p>
</li>
<li>An exception is produced that causes the flow to end unsuccessfully. This action moves the file to 
the backout subdirectory.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle"> Note: </span> Messages that cannot be routed are written to 
a default destination. This action is not treated as an error.
<p>Any failure that stops a record being read from the file and written to disk is treated as an error.</p></div>
