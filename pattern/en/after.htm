	<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete after generating the <span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the broker archive (BAR) file. Add the generated message flow to your BAR file. 
In the Broker Archive editor, you must select the <span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> option before you build the BAR file. 
If you have used a message set to define how records are parsed, you must add the message set to the BAR file.
</li>
<li>Configure the broker archive file. Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive file 
is not required
before you deploy the message flows for your <span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern instance, 
but you might want to review some of the default options and configure changes for your environment.
<p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Manage</span> page of the <span class="uicontrol">Broker Archive</span> 
editor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Optional: Use the 
	<span class="msobjprop">LoggingOn</span> user-defined property to
		select whether logging is on or off for the message flow.</li>
	<li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span> 
	user-defined property to select whether
		error messages are generated.</li>
	<li>Optional: You can also change any of the configurable properties
		in the broker archive, for example, properties for security or creating
		additional instances. You must ensure that any values that you
		change do not impact the behavior of the pattern instance.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. The summary file 
 is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 <i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
 
 <li>Create the queues. When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is generated with
queue names and queue manager names, these WebSphere MQ queues must be created if they do
not already exist. All the message settings that are required by the pattern are
set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue settings.</li>

<li>Create the <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources. 
You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources 
either on the command line, by using programs and utilities such as 
<span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by 
using the <span>WebSphere MQ</span> Explorer graphical interface. 
For more information about creating 
<span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources, see <span>WebSphere MQ</span> Intercommunication,
available on the 
<img src="../images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" />
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere MQ
library web page</a>.</li>
<li>
If you use the <span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span> value in the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter, 
you can define routes dynamically in the database 
but the routes are not listed in the summary file. 
If you have added routes to the database, 
you must create the corresponding queues and queue managers.   </li>
<li>Set up a routing database if required.
If the <span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span> value is selected in the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter, the data source
must be set up with a ROUTING_TABLE table. This table must include the following columns:
<ul>
<li>ROUTING_CONTEXT
<p>Use a value that identifies the routing entries for this flow.</p>
</li>
<li>VARIABLE1
<p>The value that the <span class="msobjprop">KEY1</span> property 
from the message element must match.</p>
</li>
<li>VARIABLE2
<p>The value that the <span class="msobjprop">KEY2</span> property 
from the message element must match.</p>
</li>
<li>QUEUE_MANAGER
<p>The queue manager of the destination.</p>
</li>
<li>QUEUE_NAME
<p>The destination queue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have chosen to use FTP to obtain input files, 
you must create an FtpServer configurable service 
on the target broker matching the name specified in your pattern. 
This action is required by the FileInput node to connect to the remote FTP server.</li>
<li>Deploy the BAR file. If a message set is used to define records, this message set 
must be deployed by using the same, or another, BAR file.
</li>
</ol>
