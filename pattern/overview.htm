<div>
	<p class="shortdesc">Use the <span>Record Distribution to WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> 
	pattern to bridge file based and transaction based styles of integration. </p>
	
	<p> Use this pattern when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have batches of transactions that are received as files from local or remote systems.</li>
<li>Your transactions cannot be sent as individual transactions because of:
<ul>
<li>the technical limitations of source systems that support file based integration capabilities only.</li> 
<li>the business requirements that mandate batching, for example, the collection of all transactions 
within a working day.</li>
<li>conformance to existing working practices, for example, the use of files that contain EDI transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your target systems are designed to accept individual transactions. Such systems might take input from 
near real-time systems and from batch files and therefore present a transactional interface.</li>	
<li>You have batch files containing transactions that must be distributed to one or more systems.</li>
<li>The records must be processed, but any failures can be handled by reprocessing the entire file.</li>
</ul>

	<h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
</div>
<p>The solution is to implement a message flow that reads records from a file and routes each record to a
WebSphere MQ destination according to routing rules, or to a default destination if a match is not found 
in the routing rules.</p>
